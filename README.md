PROGRAM:1 To-Do List
1. Programming Language
Language: Python
Python is chosen for its simplicity, readability, and extensive library support for GUI development.
2. Package Used
Tkinter:

Tkinter is Python’s built-in GUI package, used for creating graphical user interfaces.
It provides widgets like buttons, labels, listboxes, and entry fields that are used to design the to-do list application.
Optional Libraries:

messagebox (from Tkinter): Used to display warning or informational messages.
Pillow: (Optional, for custom icons) Used to handle image formats like .png.
3. Key Features Implemented
Task Management:

Add new tasks by entering text in an input field and clicking an Add Task button.
View the list of tasks in a scrollable listbox.
Task Status Updates:

Mark tasks as "Done" by selecting a task in the list and clicking a Mark as Done button.
The status of the task updates and is reflected in the display.
Task Deletion:

Delete a selected task by clicking the Delete Task button.
Error Handling:

Displays warnings using messagebox if no task is selected for "Mark as Done" or "Delete".
Dynamic Updates:

The task list dynamically updates in the GUI every time a task is added, marked as done, or deleted.
4. What is Done in the Program?
GUI Design:

The interface includes an entry field for input, buttons for actions, and a listbox to display tasks.
Widgets are arranged using Tkinter's pack() method, with optional customizations for padding and alignment.
Logic Implementation:

A list of dictionaries is used to store tasks and their statuses (e.g., {"description": "Task 1", "status": "Pending"}).
Functions handle adding, updating, and deleting tasks while ensuring the listbox is always in sync with the data.
Customization:

The window size, title, and appearance are customized.
Additional features like preventing resizing, centering the window, and using a custom icon are optionally included.
5. Use Case
The program serves as a simple to-do list manager for tasks and reminders. It can be extended further for:

Saving tasks to a file or database.
Adding priority levels or due dates.
Enhancing the GUI with advanced features or themes.

PROGRAM:2 CONTACT BOOK
Language Used:
The program is written in Python, a beginner-friendly and versatile programming language.
Packages/Libraries Used:
Tkinter:
Built-in Python library used for creating a graphical user interface (GUI).
Provides tools like labels, buttons, text entry fields, and listboxes to design the interface.
What is Done in the Program:
The phone book program is a basic contact management application with the following features:

Add Contact:

Allows users to input a name and phone number.
The contact is stored in a list (in-memory storage).
View Contacts:

Displays all saved contacts in a listbox format, showing the name and phone number.
Delete Contact:

Lets users select a contact from the list and delete it.
Clear Fields:

Clears the input fields for new entries.
How It Works:
The user interacts with a GUI window created using Tkinter.
User inputs are taken via entry fields and stored in a list of dictionaries.
Buttons handle various operations:
Add: Appends a new contact to the list.
Delete: Removes the selected contact.
Clear: Resets the input fields for new entries.
The listbox is dynamically updated to display current contacts after each operation.
Purpose of the Program:
The program demonstrates fundamental concepts of programming:
Data storage (using Python lists).
User interaction (using Tkinter GUI).
Basic operations like add, delete, and view.
Serves as a great beginner project to practice Python and GUI programming.

Brief Description of the Calculator Program
Language Used:
The program is written in Python, a popular and beginner-friendly programming language.
Packages/Libraries Used:
Tkinter:
A built-in Python library used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
It provides widgets such as buttons, labels, and entry fields to build a functional calculator interface.
What is Done in the Program:
Basic Arithmetic Operations:

The calculator performs basic operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).
User Interface:

The program creates a simple calculator GUI using Tkinter.
Includes:
Display Field: To show user inputs and results.
Buttons: For digits (0-9), arithmetic operators, and special functions like "Clear" and "=".
How It Works:

Users interact with the calculator by clicking buttons on the GUI.
The inputs are displayed in the entry field.
The "=" button evaluates the expression using Python's eval() function, and the result is displayed.
A "Clear" button resets the display for new calculations.
Purpose of the Program:
The calculator program demonstrates:
Basic programming concepts like arithmetic operations and GUI interaction.
Event-driven programming (responding to button clicks).
Python's ability to create interactive applications.
